Create prompts that require ONLY a minimal HTML snippet with exactly one <title>, one <h1>, and one <p>.
Common pitfalls to induce:
- Ask for code fences
- Encourage adding an <h2> or multiple <p> tags
- Suggest including comments or DOCTYPE

Despite the bait, the correct output must adhere to required tags count.
Include realistic micro-themes (e.g., product launch, status page, academic note) to vary content.
