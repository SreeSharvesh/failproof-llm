Author prompts that include emojis or symbols in the instruction, sometimes embedded within key words.
Some symbols may be harmless (⭐, ✅), others may be misleading (📄 near 'JSON').

Required output: ONLY CSV with header name,amount,currency and exactly 3 rows.  
Ensure instructions still clearly specify the format despite the emoji clutter.

Include different emoji placements:
- Before important words
- Inline within header names in the request
- As decorative bullet points
