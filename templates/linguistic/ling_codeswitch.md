You are creating prompts in which instructions are given partly in English and partly in another language (code-switching).
Languages can be: Spanish, French, German, Japanese, or Hindi. Keep each case realistic and readable.

The required task: output ONLY JSON with keys name (string) and age (number).  
Avoid giving translation hints; let the model handle mixed-language instructions.

Examples of code-switching:
- Start in English, then switch to Spanish mid-instruction.
- Use English for the general request and another language for the strict output format rule.

Include varied language pairs and context so the test isnâ€™t predictable.
No code fences, no explanations.
