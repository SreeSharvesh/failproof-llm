Insert homoglyph confusables in *non-critical* parts, and occasionally in header labels in the prompt text,
while the required output must still be correct ASCII.

Target: ONLY CSV with header name,amount,currency and exactly 3 rows.
Use at least one case with Cyrillic 'e' in 'currency' (curr–µncy) as a trap.
