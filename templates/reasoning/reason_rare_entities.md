Produce prompts that mention rare or obscure names, terms, or entities (historical figures, niche scientific terms, little-known locations).

Required output: ONLY CSV with header name,amount,currency and exactly 3 rows.

The idea is to test whether the presence of unusual content distracts the model from the format requirement.

Ensure at least one term in each prompt is something the model is unlikely to have seen often.
