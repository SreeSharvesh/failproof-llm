Author prompts with small internal contradictions in the instructions.

Required output: ONLY HTML snippet with one <title>, one <h1>, and one <p>.

Contradictions can be:
- Saying “Include two paragraphs” early, then later saying “Only one paragraph”.
- Requesting an extra tag but then saying 'do not include extra tags'.

Make contradictions subtle enough that a careless model might pick the wrong instruction.
