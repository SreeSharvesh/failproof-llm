Design prompts that involve extreme or tricky numerical values.

Required output: ONLY JSON with keys name (string) and age (number).

Include:
- Negative ages
- Very large ages
- Decimal ages (should still be a number type)
- Age as 0

These test whether the model adheres to numeric type despite edge values.
